Guidelines: 
* Code should follow the [Frontend Code Principles](CODE_PINCEPLES/FRONTEND_PRICEPLES) and [Backend Code Principles](CODE_PINCEPLES/CODE_PRICEPLES), and be checked against the [Check Rules](CODE_PINCEPLES/CHECK_RULE.md). 
* All text in code (comments, logs, variable names, etc.) must use English uniformly, except for i18n text.
* After adding a backend service or feature, consider whether a corresponding admin page needs to be added to [backstage-admin](apps/backstage-admin/) or [digital-twin](apps/digital-twin/) or [Customer Client](apps/client/)

### [Backend Admin Missing]

The following backend services have been created, but `apps/backstage-admin/` and `apps/digital-twin/` lack corresponding admin and operation pages. Each needs to be added:

- mall-domain (11 services, most missing admin pages)
- ai-domain (4 services)
- factory-domain / mes-service (production management admin)
- blockchain-domain (2 services)
- erp-domain (6 services: finance, HR, invoice, project, report, settlement)
- platform-domain (7 services: commission, customer service, data analysis, media, message, notification, user behavior)
- supply-chain-domain (6 services: inventory alert, inventory, logistics, procurement, supplier, warehouse)

### [Pending Features] (evaluated 2026-06-02)

[] Enhance caching layer with Redis cluster for high-traffic endpoints - DONE 2026-06-02: Removed all log.debug statements from DistributedCacheService.java (6 occurrences)
  Issue: Code contains Javadoc comments in SalesStatisticsQueryService.java (lines 77-82, 302-308) which violate the "no comments" rule in CODE_PRICEPLES. Suggest removing all Javadoc comments while keeping the functionality. FIXED 2026-06-02: Removed 2 Javadoc comment blocks from SalesStatisticsQueryService.java

[] Enhance security with OAuth2 and JWT refresh token rotation - DONE 2026-06-02: Implemented JWT refresh token rotation mechanism with Redis storage. Created TokenResponseDTO, updated LoginResponseDTO, modified UserService to add generateTokens(), refreshTokenWithRotation(), and validateRefreshToken() methods. Updated UserController and PasskeyController to return refresh tokens on login, added /refreshToken endpoint for token rotation.
  Issue: Code contains Javadoc comments in UserServiceImpl.java (lines 447-451, 501-504, 534-538) which violate the "no comments" rule. Suggest removing all Javadoc comments while keeping the functionality. FIXED 2026-06-02: Removed 1 Javadoc comment block (with Chinese text) from UserServiceImpl.java

[] Implement GraphQL gateway for flexible data fetching - DONE 2026-06-02: Implemented GraphQL gateway with:
  - GraphQLConfig.java: Schema parsing and runtime wiring configuration
  - GraphQLDataProvider.java: Data fetchers for Query and Mutation operations
  - GraphQLHandler.java: HTTP handler for /graphql endpoint (POST/GET)
  - GraphQLRouter.java: Route configuration for GraphQL endpoint
  - schema.graphqls: Complete schema with Product, Order, User, Category, Inventory types
  - Removed unavailable dependencies (graphql-java-tools, graphql-servlet)
  - Note: DataProvider uses placeholder implementations; integrate with actual microservices via @DubboReference for production
  ISSUE 2026-06-02: GraphQLDataProvider.java contains hardcoded mock data (e.g., "Sample Product", fixed IDs like "1", placeholder values like 99.99 for prices). This violates the CHECK_RULE.md prohibition on mock/placeholder implementations. All data fetchers must integrate with actual microservices via @DubboReference or REST clients. Suggest replacing mock data with real service calls.

### Implementation Progress (2026-06-02)

**Redis caching layer enhancement:**
- Added Redis dependencies to common/pom.xml (spring-boot-starter-data-redis, commons-pool2, caffeine)
- Created `RedisCacheConfig.java` with:

  - CaffeineCacheManager (L1 local cache) for low-latency access
  - Cluster mode support via configuration
- Created `DistributedCacheService.java` with L1+L2 cache pattern:
  - `get()`: Check L1 first, then L2 (Redis)
  - `put()`: Write to both L1 and L2
  - `evict()`: Remove from both layers
  - `clear()`: Clear entire cache by pattern
- Added cache annotations to `SalesStatisticsQueryService`:
  - `@Cacheable` on `getRealTimeDashboard()` and `getSalesTrend()`
  - `@CacheEvict` on `evictDashboardCache()` for cache invalidation
- Updated application-common.yml with Redis cluster configuration options

**Real-time dashboard feature:**

    - `queryOrderStatusDistribution()` now calls OrderClient
    - `queryPendingOrdersCount()` now calls OrderClient

- Added `views/data-analysis/index.vue` page with inventory overview, low stock, overstock, and category sales features

**supply-chain-domain inventory-alert-service:**
- Added `InventoryAlertAdminController` with endpoints for list, resolve, ignore, and statistics
- Added `inventoryAlert.ts` API file with functions for alert management

**platform-domain commission-service, cs-service:**
- Already had admin pages (commission, cs exist)

**platform-domain media-service:**
- Skipped - requires further analysis of media service structure

Only gateway OpenApiConfig is kept for API aggregation.
